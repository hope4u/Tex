[Jindal]
The Paper proposes an algorithm which optimizes the throughput with an SIC receiver, the papers goal is to solve the problem of beam forming in a Broadcast or downlink Channel, so exactly the opposite direction than we are discussing in this report. But as //paper has described there is a duality of these two channels and we are able to use the optimized results of the MAC to optimize the BC. So his work is using this duality to solve the easer problem of the MAC and then transform it back to the BC problem, so his work is highly relevant to us.\\
