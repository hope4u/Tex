\section{MIMO}
IN the thrive for higher data rates the limits of the basic single Antenna communication channels became obvious. The bandwidth limitation due to scarcity and cost and power constraints due to physics and regulations called for different approaches. MIMO uses the spatial dimension of the channel to further increase reliability and speed.

\subsection{from SISO to MIMO}
We are still using the assumptions of frequency- and time-flat channels. In the SISO case the discrete complex baseband channel tab $h$ characterized the channel sufficiently. If we now use multiple antennas an the transmitter and receiver side of the channel and make sure that they are sufficiently spaced it establishes multiple distinct channels due to small-scale fading processes. In this case our discrete complex baseband channel tab $h$ is no longer a single coefficient but a matrix $\mathbf{H}\in\mathbb{C}^{N\times M}$ with $M$ number of transmit antennas and $N$ number of receive antennas. 
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{H} = \begin{bmatrix}
		h_{11} & h_{12} & \hdots & h_{1M} \\
		h_{21} & h_{22} & \hdots & h_{2M} \\
		\vdots & \vdots & \hdots & \vdots \\
		h_{N1} & h_{N2} & \hdots & h_{NM} \\
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

the input output relation of a MIMO channel is then written as 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{y}[m] = \mathbf{Hx}[m] + \mathbf{w}[m]
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{C}^M , \mathbf{y}\in\mathbb{C}^N$ and $\mathbf{w}\sim\mathcal{CN}(0,N_0\mathbf{I}_N)$


\subsection{MIMO Capacity}
the capacity of a MIMO channel without any precodeing can be written as:
\begin{equation}
	C = \log_2{\det{\Biggr[\mathbf{I}_N + \frac{\text{SNR}}{M}\mathbf{HH}^H\Biggl]}}
\end{equation}
with $\text{SNR}$ as total transmit power $P$ over noise power $N_0$.


% For a SISO channel in a Rayleigh fading channel we get a bit error rate off
% \begin{equation}
% 	P_b(|h|^2) = 1/2 \erfc{\Biggl(\sqrt{|h|^2\frac{\bar{E_b}}{N_0}}\Biggr)}.
% \end{equation}
% , if we now send the same signal over $N$ statistically independent channels we get a BER of
% \begin{equation}
% 	P_b(|h|^2) = 1/2 \erfc{\Biggl(\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^N{|h_j|^2\frac{E_s}{N_0}}}\Biggr)}
% \end{equation}
% for the equivalent SISO channel.
